This isn't a blog post per se...

You know how most people would rather cozy up under their blankets instead of stepping out after a heavy downpour on a Saturday morning?

Now insert Lagos, Nigeria into the mix and you have a Saturday morning where most people would rather cozy up under their blankets instead of stepping out into the chilly and most likely flooded streets.

Well, given the above scenario to be true on Saturday the 20th of May 2017, you can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to see a very decent turn out at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Lagos/" target="_blank">Docker Lagos Meetup</a> which held at SwitchNG's office.

It was the second Docker Lagos Meetup and there were good folks like Abiola Ibrahim (the host), Tunde Alex-Oni and myself talking all things Docker. 

I spoke about the basics of Docker. Here is the slide for my presentation.

I will be happy to discuss more on Docker and learn a thing or two from you :)
